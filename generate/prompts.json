What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?\n\nLet's think step by step to solve the problem.\n\nSince 36 hours is equivalent to 1 day and 12 hours, if 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then today's date is December 30, 2014. One week is 7 days, so the date one week from today is January 6, 2015, that is 01/06/2015. So the answer is 01/06/2015.\n\n\nQuestion: The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?\n\nLet's think step by step to solve the problem.\n\nIf the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, then January 1, 2019 is a Tuesday. Since Monday is the day before Tuesday, if today is the first Monday of 2019, then the date today is January 7, 2019, that is 01/07/2019. So the answer is 01/07/2019.\n\n\nQuestion: The concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?\n\nLet's think step by step to solve the problem.\n\nIf the concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943 and was delayed by one day to today, then today is 06/02/1943. 10 days before today is 05/23/1943. So the answer is 05/23/1943.\n\n\nQuestion: It is 4/19/1969 today. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?\n\nLet's think step by step to solve the problem.\n\nSince 24 hours is equivalent to 1 day, if today is 4/19/1969, then the date 24 hours later is 4/20/1969. So the answer is 04/20/1969.\n\n\nQuestion: Jane thought today is 3/11/2002, but today is in fact Mar 12, which is 1 day later. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?\n\nLet's think step by step to solve the problem.\n\nSince 24 hours is equivalent to 1 day, if today is March 12, 2002, then the date 24 hours later is March 13, 2002, that is 03/13/2002. So the answer is 03/13/2002.\n\n\nQuestion: Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?\n\nLet's think step by step to solve the problem.\n\nIf Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, and since the last day of February in 2001 was February 28th, then Jane was born on February 28, 2001. If today is her 16-year-old birthday, then today is February 28, 2017. The date yesterday is February 27, 2017, that is 02/27/2017. So the answer is 02/27/2017.\n\n\n"
